#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 3

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage Three**, you will take the connected application you yu built in **Stage One** and **Stage Two** and add additional functionality. You will add a form to allow users to create their own reviews. If the app is offline, your form will defer updating to the remote database until a connection is established. Finally, you’ll work to optimize your site to meet even stricter performance benchmarks than the previous project, and test again using [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/).

### Specification

You will be provided code for an updated [Node development server](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3) and a README for getting the server up and running locally on your computer. The README will also contain the API you will need to make JSON requests to the server. Once you have the server up, you will begin the work of improving your **Stage Two** project code.

    This server is different than the server from stage 2, and has added capabilities.
    Make sure you are using the Stage Three server as you develop your project.
    Connecting to this server is the same as with Stage Two, however.

You can find the documentation for the new server in the README file for the server.
Now that you’ve connected your application to an external database, it’s time to begin adding new features to your app.

### Steps to complete

1. Fork and clone the [server repository](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3). You’ll use this development server to develop your project code.
2. Add a form to allow users to submit their own reviews.
3. Add functionality to defer submission of the form until connection is re-established.
4. Follow the recommendations provided by Lighthouse to achieve the required performance targets.
5. Submit your project code for review.
